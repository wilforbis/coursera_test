	Here is some content. As a result of my fascination with Waits, I snatched up a copy of Barney Hoskyns’ biography, “The Low Side of the Road,” when I caught sight of it at my neighborhood library. I found the book disappointing; it’s not much more than a chronological blow-by-blow of Waits’ career mixed in with analysis of his songs. However, the book does explore the interesting idea that one must distinguish Tom Waits the persona from Tom Waits the actual person. As Hoskyns tells it, Waits spent his formative years (teens and early twenties) assembling the parts that would become the public Tom Waits---the character who would appear on stage or in interviews. This Waits was a pastiche the music of Tin Pan Alley, the poetry of the Beats, the voice of radio DJ Wolfman Jack, the attitude of Charles Bukowski, and the glamorized lifestyle and tragedy of alcoholic hobos. Waits amalgamated all these influences into his performance, speech and even dress.
